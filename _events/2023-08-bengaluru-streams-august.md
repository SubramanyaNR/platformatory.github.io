### Talks

- **Apace Pulsar - The anatomy of Pub & Sub**

_Speaker:_ **Shivji Kumar Jha - Staff Engineer at Nutanix**

_About the talk:_ This is a deep tech presentation on what Apache Pulsar ( a great choice for streaming and messaging) does internally to store a message and give it back in single digit milliseconds at high throughput. We will look at the internal data structures, APIs, read and write paths that make a streaming engine efficient given the expectations and constraints. This talk will give you a great perspective on what and how of designing your apps right to make the best use of Apache Pulsar (or any other streaming framework), We push 100 MB messages per second at peak and it is one boring technology that just works for us with close to zero maintenance.

- **Empowering Interactive Queries on Lakehouse: Integrating Apache Hudi with Presto & Trino**

_Speaker:_ **Sagar Sumit, Apache Committer and Software Engineer at Onehouse**

_About the talk:_ Apache Hudi is revolutionizing big data analytics by optimizing lakehouse architecture for efficient upserts, deletes, and incremental processes. As query engines like Presto and Trino become increasingly prominent in data ecosystems, the need for swift querying and on-the-fly data exploration becomes paramount. This talk dives deep into the harmonization between Hudi and these engines, showcasing how their integration yields unparalleled query performance on petabyte-scale datasets, all while ensuring data freshness. Attendees will gather insights into the architectural intricacies, the challenges of integration, and the manifold benefits stemming from this collaboration.

- **Designing a Data Mesh with Kafka**

_Speaker:_ **Rahul Gulati - Principal Engineer at Saxo Bank**

_About the talk:_ Designing a Data Mesh with Kafka “Data Mesh objective is to create a foundation for getting value from analytical data and historical facts at scale” [Dehghani, Data Mesh founder] If the central concern of a Data Mesh is about enabling analytics, then how is Kafka relevant? In this talk we will describe how we managed to apply Data Mesh founding principles to our operational plane, based on Kafka. Consequently, we have gained value from these principles more broadly than just analytics. An example of this is treating data as-a-product, i.e. that data is discoverable, addressable, trustworthy and self-describing. We will then describe our implementation, which includes deep dives into Cluster Linking, Connectors and SMTs. Finally, we discuss the dramatic simplification of our analytical plane and consuming personas. Agenda

• Saxo Bank’s implementation of the Data Mesh

• Cluster Linking - Why? How?

• Data lake connectors – configuration and auto-deployment strategy

• Mapping Kafka to the data lake infrastructure.

• Enabling analytics, data warehousing and production support
