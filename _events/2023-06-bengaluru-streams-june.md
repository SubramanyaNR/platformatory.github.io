### Talks

- **The State of Streaming & Modern Data**

_Speaker:_ **Pavan Keshavamurthy, CTO & Co-founder @ Platformatory.io**

_About the talk:_ A navigator to the initiated and uninitiated into the world of streaming: Cover the breadth of drivers, reference architectures, blueprints and tooling within the Apache Fn ecosystem.

- **Real time analytics and insights with Apache Kafka and Apache Pinot**

_Speaker:_ **Suraj Pillai - Enterprise Architect at Startree, Saurabh Dubey Software Engineer at Startree**

_About the talk:_ Apache Pinot is a real-time, distributed, analytical data store which is widely used in the industry today for internal as well as user-facing analytical use cases. The columnar data format and variety of rich indexing strategies make it a perfect fit for running highly concurrent queries on multi-dimensional data within milliseconds. It has out-of-the-box support for Apache Kafka, HDFS, S3, Presto, and so on, and can seamlessly integrate with any big data stack. In this joint session we'll be walking through Apache Pinot basics, Apache Pinot's integration with Kafka as well as some use cases. We will also do a deep dive into the Join functionality available with Apache Pinot.

- **Capturing database changes in real-time with Kafka Connect**

_Speaker:_ **Chaitanya Mukka, Senior Software Engineer at Confluent**

_About the talk:_ This talk will explore the Kafka Connect ecosystem including its core concepts. We will be exploring a popular use case - the Change Data Capture (CDC) pattern - Basics, various architectures and live demo

- **Unlocking Real-time Insights: CDC streams by the Lakehouse on Apache Hudi**

_Speaker:_ **Sagar Sumit, Apache Committer and Software Engineer at Onehouse**

_About the talk:_ 1. The current challenges of processing CDC events at scale. 2. An overview of the internals of Apache Hudi. 3. How Hudi and Apache Kafka unlock incremental processing of CDC events on the lakehouse. 4. How Hudi manages data lifecycle through compaction and cleaning while simultaneously offering ACID semantics on the lake.

- **Beyond Kafka: Exploring NATS for Modern Event-Driven Architectures**

_Speaker:_ **Robin Biju Thomas, Technical Architect**

_About the talk:_ In this talk, we will delve into the world of modern event-driven architectures and explore how NATS can be a compelling alternative to Kafka. We will discuss the key features, benefits, and use cases of NATS, highlighting its strengths in building scalable, efficient, and resilient event-driven systems.
