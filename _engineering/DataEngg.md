The Digital age and the resulting data rush brings forth not only big data but also fast data. In the new world order, centralized data lakes, warehouses (and teams) can no longer deliver the business requirements for delivering time to insight. Lambda architecture is passe, enter Kappa architecture and data mesh. This is no easy transition; Infact, it lies at the intersection of infrastructure, application integration, data engineering and analytics -- all defined within the context boundaries of the business domain. 

We help customers level up streaming maturity, with white glove assistance on a whole spectrum of Apache Foundation technologies.
